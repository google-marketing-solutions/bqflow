# Private Copies Of The Code

You can
[fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
the BQFlow repository and create your own private team repo to customize
the code. You are NOT required nor obligated to contribute back your changes to
the open source repository. The code is covered by
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) giving you
full ability to use and modify this code for any purpose including commercial
use.

# How to Contribute

Create a
[fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
which makes a copy of the code in your own private repository that you can
modify as needed. Make the changes, commit them to your private repository. Then
perform a
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
which will present the commits you chose to the main BQFlow open source
repository for review.

Before the Pull Request can be accepted and merged, there are a few requirements
to clear:

*   Obtain a peer review and approval for your code by another human person,
    including BQFlow maintainers if you don't have anyone you can ask to.
    *   The person reviewing your code should confirm that the code does what it
        is intended to do, and that it doesn't "cut corners" to do that.
*   Once you have obtained approval, a bot will generate a request for the
    BQFlow maintainers. Wait for the maintainers to review the code and
    work on any change that might be requested by them.
*   Once the request is accepted by the maintainers, a bot will sync the code to
    BQFlow internal repository and eventually merge and close the Pull
    Request.

# Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub Pull Requests for this purpose. Consult
